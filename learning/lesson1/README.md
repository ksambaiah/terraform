## Cloud

AWS stands for amazon web services, also called amazon cloud. You can create an account on AWS services and login to the AWS.

AWS cloud has data centers across the world. Here is the partial list of aws regions![aws regions](./aws_regions.png?raw=true). One can get list of all regions at [aws regions list](https://awsregion.info/).
If you are operating with one region and region has only one data center, failure of the datacenter can cause downtime to your application. AWS split each data center into three availability zones spread around some distance. 

We start working with creating multiple users and working with setting up the command line.
